Delivering type-setting equations in prose and plots as functions for statistics and probability curricula

## Abstract 

Mathematical fluency involves frequent use of equations. However, typing out equations for use in electronic documents can be tedious. In a classroom setting with a set curriculum, the set of equations to be mastered is well defined. Having shortcuts to produce this set of equations in prose or plots could be beneficial for students and instructors alike.  The goal of this independent study is to create functions that will quickly deliver the typed versions of equations that translate into beautiful printed versions. We will store the typed versions and thoughtfully crafted R functions to make these typed equations easily accessible. The functions will be bundled into an R package.


# The problem

Using mathematical notation is a powerful way to communicate about probabilistic and statistical concept.  When notation is combined with data visualization or descriptive prose that power is even greater.  

However, using equations in these contexts is often done by typing in a typesetting version of the equation; this can be awkward.  Consider the probability density function for the normal distribution, centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma$:

```{r, warning=F, out.width="20%", echo = F}
math_plot_normal <- "p(x) * {phantom() == phantom()} * frac(1, sqrt(2*pi*sigma^{2}, )) * phantom(.)*e^{phantom() - frac((x - mu)^{2}, 2*sigma^{2})} "

library(ggplot2)
ggxmean:::stamp_space() + 
  annotate(geom = "text", 
           label = math_plot_normal,
           parse = T,
           x = 2, y = .3, size = 20) + 
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) + 
  theme_void()
```

The typed version of this equation which follows is a distant cousin from its beautiful rendered kin above:

`p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }} e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} }`

Furthermore, if we want to use annotate a plot with this equation, we would need to use plot math, a different typed syntax.

`p(x) * {phantom() == phantom()} * frac(1, sqrt(2*pi*sigma^{2}, )) * phantom(.)*e^{phantom() - frac((x - mu)^{2}, 2*sigma^{2})} `

```{r, warning=F}
math_plot_normal <- "p(x) * {phantom() == phantom()} * frac(1, sqrt(2*pi*sigma^{2}, )) * phantom(.)*e^{phantom() - frac((x - mu)^{2}, 2*sigma^{2})} "

library(ggplot2)
ggxmean:::stamp_space() + 
  annotate(geom = "label", 
           label = math_plot_normal,
           parse = T,
           x = 2, y = .3) + 
  ggxmean::stamp_normal_dist() + 
  ggstamp::stamp_text_ljust(label = "What is the max of this function?",
                      x = -4, 
                      y = .44)
```
<!-- Fortunately, a translater exists. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- exp_to_plot <- latex2exp::TeX("$p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ 2 \\pi \\sigma^2 }} e^{ - \\frac{ (x - \\mu)^2 } {2 \\sigma^2} }$") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Consider Ian Stewart's poster below, 'Equations that changed the world.'  We see the equations themselves and a verbal way to refer to the equations - the equation's name.  The typesetting version, thankfully, does not appear.  

In a setting where you are using software, it might be preferable to refer to the equation by name rather than always typing of the typesetting version.  For example `typeset_pathagoreans()` could return `$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $` which could be copy and pasted or used dynamically in a hybrid prose/code document like jupiter notebooks, rmarkdown, or quarto.  

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/equations_that_changed_world.png")
```


# A different work flow within intro probability and statistics course work...

What if we could call a function to get back the text that will render to our beautiful equations. For example a function like `return_equation_normal()` could be called to get the typed version of the prose and `stamp_eq_normal()` for use in ggplot2.

# 'data' collection

A large part of this project was thinking about which equations are relevant for a course like ma206. 

```{r}
read.csv("data-raw/ma389_stats_formulas.csv") |> tail(7) |> knitr::kable()

# for preparation of stamp functions
readLines("data-raw/plotmath_equations_template.txt")

```

To see exactly how we used the template to generate all the functions for this package, see the processing code [here](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206equations/blob/main/data-raw/process_excel_file.Rmd).

```{r, eval = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggxmean:::stamp_space() + 
  stamp_equation_normal() 
```



# Solution: package with key equations



The equations in the plot were produce in the following fashion (no functions or package pre-built): 

```{r, eval = T, warning=F, message=F}

equation_z_stat_md <- "$z=\\frac{\\hat{p}-\\pi}{SD_{null}}$, where $SD_{null}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_{0}*(1-\\pi_{0})}{n}}$"

equation_z_stat_plot <- latex2exp::TeX(equation_z_stat_md)

equation_conf_interval_z_md <- "$CI = \\hat{p}\\pm Multiplier*SE$, where $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}*(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$"

equation_conf_interval_z_plot <- latex2exp::TeX(equation_conf_interval_z_md)


library(tidyverse)

ggplot() +
  annotate("label", 
           x = 0, y = 0, 
           label = equation_z_stat_plot, 
           color = "grey25", size = 4)

ggplot() +
  annotate("label", 
           x = 0, y = 0, 
           label = equation_conf_interval_z_plot, 
           color = "grey25", size = 4)

```

$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

`r equation_z_stat_md` 

$$\alpha$$

# How do we write a package?


- We will still follow the steps outlined in this data package readme: https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/tidytitanic
- As well as consult the package building guide: https://evamaerey.github.io/package_in_20_minutes/package_in_20_minutes

## Which equations are relevant for the statistics and probability course?

A good start for looking at the core of equations used in ma206 is the code annex:

- Rendered:  https://evamaerey.github.io/ma206/code_annex.html
- Source: https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206/blob/master/code_annex.Rmd



Result would be to quickly include relevant formulas in plots (like ggplot below which looks at proposal 1/3 as null hypothesis for a proportion) and .rmd documents.
